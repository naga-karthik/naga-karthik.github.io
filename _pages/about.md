Hi there! 👋 

I'm Naga, a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [University Health Network](https://www.uhnresearch.ca), affiliated with the Department of Medicine at the University of Toronto. I received my PhD from Polytechnique Montréal with a dual affiliation to [Mila - Québec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en). 

During my PhD, I worked on developing deep learning-based methods for medical image analysis, with a particular focus on improving the estimation of imaging biomarkers using spinal cord imaging data. I have developed automatic tools for segmentation of the spinal cord and lesions across various MRI contrasts and pathologies such as spinal cord injury (SCI) and multiple sclerosis (MS). I have also experimented with generative modelling, in particular, training GANs for cross-modality MR-CT synthesis and diffusion models for synthesizing spinal cord lesions. In the past, I have also worked on the application of continual/lifelong learning methods for the segmentation of brain MS lesions. 

When I am not working, you'll find me either running :running:, hiking :mountain:, or reading :book:.
