Hi there! I'm Naga, a fourth-year PhD student at [NeuroPoly](https://neuro.polymtl.ca), Polytechnique Montréal. I'm also affiliated to [Mila - Québec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en). During my PhD, I worked on developing deep learning-based methods for medical image analysis, with a particular focus on improving the estimation of imaging biomarkers using real-world spinal cord imaging data. I have developed automatic tools for segmentation of the spinal cord and lesions across various MRI contrasts and pathologies such as spinal cord injury (SCI), multiple sclerosis (MS) and degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM). I have also experimented with generative modelling, in particular, training GANs for cross-modality MR-CT synthesis and diffusion models for synthesizing spinal cord lesions. In the past, I have also worked on the application of continual/lifelong learning methods for the segmentation of brain MS lesions. Please head to my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZryIoMMAAAAJ&hl=en) profile for a complete list of my publications.

When I am not working, you'll find me either running :running:, hiking :mountain:, or reading :book:.
